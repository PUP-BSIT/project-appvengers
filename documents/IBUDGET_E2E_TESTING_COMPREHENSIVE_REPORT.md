## 1. Testing Methodology

### 1.1 Testing Approach

**Manual End-to-End Testing with Automation Assistance**

Our testing methodology combines the thoroughness of manual E2E testing with the efficiency of modern automation tools:

1. **Manual Test Execution:** Human testers manually perform all test scenarios to validate real-world user experiences
2. **Playwright MCP Automation:** Browser automation framework used to accelerate repetitive tasks and navigation
3. **AI-Assisted Testing:** AI tools assist with test case generation, data preparation, and result documentation
4. **Production Environment Testing:** All tests executed against live production environment (https://i-budget.site)

### 1.2 Tools and Technologies

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Playwright MCP** | Browser automation framework | Element interaction, navigation, screenshot capture |
| **AI Testing Assistant** | Test acceleration and documentation | Test case generation, result analysis, report compilation |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Debugging and inspection | Network monitoring, console logs, element inspection |
| **Manual Testing** | Primary test execution method | Real user interaction, UX validation, exploratory testing |

### 12.6 Previously Pending Tests - Now Completed ✅

| Test ID | Module | Test Name | Priority | Status | Verification Date |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| CAT-013 | Categories | Empty State - Income | P2 | ✅ PASSED | Jan 9, 2026 |
| RPT-GUARD-001 | Reports | Auth Guard Redirect | P0 | ✅ PASSED | Jan 9, 2026 |
| RPT-RESP-001 | Reports | Responsive Charts | P3 | ✅ PASSED | Jan 9, 2026 |

**Verification Notes:**
- **CAT-013:** Empty state correctly appears after user deletes all default income categories. Every new account has pre-built categories, so empty state triggers only on manual deletion.
- **RPT-GUARD-001:** Auth guard verified working correctly on production - unauthenticated users are properly redirected to login page.
- **RPT-RESP-001:** Charts tested on mobile devices and show proper responsive behavior - charts resize correctly and maintain readability.
